      <p>
          Under the working title of “<b>SharedAirDFW</b>” over 100 new custom-built air quality monitors 
          are being distributed throughout the DFW region in the next 12 months that will be able to 
          give residents real time information about the air they breathe for the first time. When it’s 
          up and running, <b>it’ll be the first network of its kind in Texas and one of the largest in the U.S.</b><br><br>

          Based out of the <b>University of Texas at Dallas</b> laboratories and built and calibrated by its 
          graduate and undergraduate students, and supported by grants from the NSF, Earth Day Texas, the US Army,
          Downwinders at Risk, the City of Plano, TX, and the US EPA. These monitors will offer real time information
          every few seconds through a <b>easily accessible app.</b> In addition, all data is made available in <b>real-time.</b><br><br>

          Right now a handful of official EPA regulatory grade monitors provide hourly average air quality information with a
          latency of a few hours behind real time conditions. <b>SharedAirDFW will increase the number of calibrated air quality
          monitors in DFW by a factor of about forty while giving readings updated every few seconds.</b><br><br>

          Some of the first monitor deployments will be across the campus of UT Dallas in Joppa (South Dallas), West Dallas, and
          Midlothian, around Paul Quinn College for the Southern Dallas neighborhoods surrounding its campus, and across the City
          of Plano.

    <hr style="width:450px;display:block;">
    <p>Particulate matter are microscopic solid or liquid matter suspended in the air. 
       They have impacts on climate and precipitation that adversely affect human health, in addition to direct inhalation. 
       Particulate matter smaller than about 10 micrometers, can settle in the bronchi and lungs and cause health problems.
       Fine particulate matter (PM2.5), tend to penetrate into the gas exchange regions of the lung, 
       and very small particles may pass through the lungs to affect other organs.
